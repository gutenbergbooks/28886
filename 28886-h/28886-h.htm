<h2>THE HICKORY LIMB</h2>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_g.jpg" alt="G" width="50" height="50" /></div>
<p>ladys Bailey had a parasol in one hand and a card-case in the other.
From her own wide experience in social usage, she was going to
initiate the twins into the mystery of formal calls. She had told them
earlier in the day that they might bring their younger sister, but
later reflection decided her to withdraw this permission. As Katherine
and Alice were ready first, it was easy to explain to them her
reasons.</p>

<p>"Four," Gladys said, "are too many to go calling. Margery's too little
for our crowd anyway, and, besides, that would make three from one
family. We had just better start before she comes down."</p>

<p>For a moment the twins looked doubtful; then, as usual, agreed.
Thereupon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> all three cautiously tiptoed off the porch and down the
lawn. Before they reached the street, Margery was after them, calling:
"Wait a minute, Katherine! Wait, Alice!"</p>

<p>The twins had barely time to slip through the gate and hear Gladys's
low injunction, "Don't let her come," when Margery was upon them.</p>

<p>"You can't come with us, Margery," Katherine began, with an assumption
of innocence.</p>

<p>"Why, Katherine, you promised I could."</p>

<p>"That was for to-morrow," suggested Alice weakly.</p>

<p>Margery looked from her sisters to Gladys, who was staring vaguely
across the street. Her excessive aloofness was suspicious, and Margery
instantly jumped to conclusions.</p>

<p>"I bet I know what's the matter. That old Gladys Bailey doesn't want
me. But I'm going anyhow! I don't care what she says! I'm going!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="pic_1" id="pic_1"></a>
<img src="images/image_01.jpg" width="600" height="538" alt="&quot;I don&#39;t care what she says! I&#39;m going!&quot;" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>And, throwing herself against the gate, Margery pushed and kicked and
shook, while Katherine and Alice, holding it shut from the outside,
blushed with embarrassment that Gladys should hear, and whispered
fiercely, "Margery, keep still!"</p>

<p>But Margery would not keep still. At that moment she was remembering
against Gladys many a former indignity. How she hated her&mdash;how she had
always hated her for her prim, deceitful, grown-up manners, for her
patronizing airs, and, most of all, for the strange influence she
wielded over Margery's own sisters and brother. It was bad enough that
the twins should hang upon her words, but worse, far worse, that even
Henry, that model of discretion, should be so completely taken in as
to look upon Gladys with an interest which bordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> dangerously near
to admiration. Secure in the esteem of Katherine and Alice, and
conscious of her sway over Henry, Gladys saw no reason to conciliate
the youngest member of the family. "Margery's too little for our
crowd," she would say, and, while Margery fumed and fought, would
calmly reiterate the statement until it came to be accepted as fact.
Gladys never fought. As on this afternoon, she was always the general,
who, so to speak, directed from afar the onslaughts of the actual
combatants.</p>

<p>Though outnumbered two to one, Margery had the spirit of a host, and
for a while victory hung doubtful. Then fate decided the issue, and,
in guise of the maternal voice from the window, called Margery off.</p>

<p>"Margery Blair," the voice commanded, "stop that noise this instant!
Aren't you ashamed to tease the girls so? Stop it! Do you hear me?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, Margery heard; and, knowing from experience the futility of
argument, she stopped.</p>

<p>"Are we ready?" Gladys Bailey asked, suddenly awakening, as it were,
from a reverie. The twins, a little heated from their exertions, were
quite ready, and, holding their card-cases&mdash;envelopes filled with
cards of home manufacture&mdash;in young-ladyish fashion, they started off,
copying, as best they could, the mincing steps of Gladys.</p>

<p>If Margery shouted after them no parting taunt, it was not because she
had none ready. The ear corresponding to the maternal voice was
probably still at the window; and Margery, though desperate enough for
any fate sufficiently tragic, disliked the thought of spending the
afternoon in bed. Therefore she kept an outward silence. But her heart
would not be still, and every little outraged feeling in her body,
finding a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> voice of its own, clamored aloud: "Oh, if we could only pay
'em back! Oh, if we could only pay 'em back!" Margery, alas! had not
yet learned that forgiveness is sweeter than revenge. Of course she
would forgive them if, say, a milk-wagon should run over her and she
had only a few hours to live. Then how they would cry! But as it was
too late in the afternoon for any milk-wagons to be about, such a
death-bed forgiveness was clearly out of the question. So the one
thing left was revenge.</p>

<p>Yet what revenge was possible? None, absolutely none. That afternoon
she was utterly powerless to shake by any act of hers the equanimity
of those three complacent young persons. There was nothing belonging
to them which she could smash, hide, or appropriate. There was nothing
they had ever said or done which now, in her hour of need, she could
use against them. They were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> fact so impossibly, so hopelessly&mdash;no,
not exactly virtuous, but <i>proper</i>, that the mere contemplation of
their colorless lives threw Margery into a most deplorable state of
hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness.</p>

<p>As the hopelessness of revenge settled on Margery's spirit, a feeling
of loneliness began to creep over her. She could think of nothing to
do, and of nobody to whom she might appeal for sympathy or amusement.
The limitless expanse of an idle afternoon stretched out before her
like a desert. Henry had gone fishing, and Willie Jones&mdash;<i>Willie
Jones!</i> With that name came a dazzling thought, a plan full-blown, a
balm sweet to her soul, a glorious solution!</p>

<p>Margery skipped up to the porch and called out in a coaxing, pleasant
tone: "Mamma, may I take a little walk?" The maternal voice, plainly
relieved that the storm had spent itself, gave consent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> and Margery
danced out the front gate and up the street, her heart thumping fast
in exultation.</p>

<p>O-oh! Let Katherine and Alice distribute as many of their
calling-cards as possible, for soon they will have no further use for
them. Soon&mdash;to be exact, by the time they get home&mdash;they will be
disgraced, horribly disgraced, and no one will ever care to receive
them or their visits again. Even Gladys, their adored Gladys, will
give them one cold glance of scorn and turn her back. It was hard,
certainly, not to be able to include Gladys in the impending doom.
But, after all, Katherine and Alice were the more culpable, for had
they not cast aside all feelings of sisterly relationship? Let them,
then, bear the brunt of the punishment.</p>

<p>After a fashion Margery was grateful to Gladys, for it was really
Gladys who had placed in her hands the weapon she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> was about to use.
Gladys was forever saying to Katherine and Alice: "If you're not
careful, Margery will disgrace you all some day. Then how will you
feel? No one will play with you; no one will even speak to you on the
street. And it won't be your fault, either. But, you see, everybody'll
know Margery is your sister."</p>

<p>Yes, every one would know, and Margery, as she skipped along, gloated
in the thought. It went without saying that, in disgracing the others,
Margery was willing to sacrifice herself. Willing? She was almost too
willing. In fact, it must be confessed that there was something in the
present undertaking which, quite apart from all anticipations of
revenge, hummed a gay little tune in her ear, and tempted her hurrying
feet into many a frisky little side-step. From time to time she had to
nudge herself, as it were, to remember that her purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> was one of
retributive justice, that the end was what her soul hungered
after&mdash;not the means.</p>

<p>She gave a passing regret to the afternoon shoes she was wearing, the
white stockings, the clean dress, the great pink bow of ribbon in her
hair. Likely enough these would be sadly draggled before the deed was
done. But even that thought did not check her haste nor cause her for
one second to pause or look back.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_h.jpg" alt="H" width="52" height="50" /></div>
<p>er road lay toward the open country. At last, leaving behind all
lines of houses, she crawled under a barbed-wire fence into a broad
meadow where a few cows were grazing; then over a creek into another
meadow, and up to a grassy knoll just ahead. From beyond it faint
shouts were coming. At the foot of the knoll Margery rested a few
moments, then pushed bravely on to the very gate of her adventure.</p>

<p>From the top of the knoll she looked down the other side to a tiny
pond where five little boys were playing and splashing. The minute
they spied Margery they sank to their chins in the muddy water and
raised frantic hands and voices:</p>

<p>"Go 'way from here! Go 'way from here! We're swimmin'! We're
swimmin'!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>With considerable inward trepidation but outward calm, Margery
descended toward them.</p>

<p>"We're swimmin'! We're swimmin'!" the little boys kept on shouting
inanely until Margery was forced to make some acknowledgment of the
information.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she called out in sarcasm undisguised, "I thought you was
flying!"</p>

<p>That seemed to make the little boys angry. They redoubled their cries
and gesticulations.</p>

<p>"Go 'way from here! Go 'way from here! You're a girl! You're a girl!"</p>

<p>"Is that so? I'm a girl, am I? I'm so glad to hear it!"</p>

<p>Margery sat down near the water's edge and gazed across defiantly at
the little boys, who were clustered together at the far end of the
pond. They were not her match at sarcasm and so were forced to answer
with inarticulate jeers. For a few seconds no more words were
exchanged. Then one of the boys attempted a parley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="pic_2" id="pic_2"></a>
<img src="images/image_02.jpg" width="600" height="415" alt="&quot;Dare you to come in swimmin&#39;! Dare you to come in
swimmin&#39;!&quot;" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p>"Margery," he began. It was Willie Jones. There was a plea and a
protest in his voice.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>Margery's sharp interrogation gave so little encouragement that Willie
Jones desisted.</p>

<p>Freddy Larkin next essayed the part of spokesman for the boys. Freddy
had curly hair and a lisp.</p>

<p>"Mardthery!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Dare you to come in thwimmin'! Dare you to come in thwim&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Willie Jones choked further utterance with a splash of water. But,
though he silenced Freddy, the other three instantly took up the cry,
"Dare you to come in swimmin'! Dare you to come in swimmin'!"</p>

<p>Margery's moment had come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Huh! You think I'm afraid, don't you? Well, I ain't!"</p>

<p>She pulled off her shoes, rolled down her white stockings, and then,
standing up, very deliberately began unbuttoning the back of her
dress.</p>

<p>For the boys this was a turn of events unexpected and most
disconcerting. Not for a moment did they really want her to accept
their dare. Why, whoever heard of a girl doing such a thing? The very
thought scandalized them deeply. Indeed, they would stop her if they
could, but it was utterly beyond their powers of expression to tell
her that the dare was a mere joke, a pleasantry that had better be
forgotten. Unable to explain this, they wriggled about uncomfortably
in the water and hid their growing confusion in half-hearted jeers.</p>

<p>When the dress was discarded, every little boy there hoped in his soul
that this might be all. The proprieties would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> be utterly
demolished if Margery would only treat as a bathing-suit her skimp
little undervest and bloomers. But Margery would not. She calmly
proceeded to undo the buttons which made these two garments one.</p>

<p>"Margery!" There was an almost agonized pleading in Willie Jones's
voice.</p>

<p>"Willie Jones, will you shut up! Just because you live near us you
needn't think you're my brother. 'Cause you ain't. Besides, girls can
do the same as boys."</p>

<p>There was a last tug; those final garments which might have served as
a bathing-suit slipped down over her feet, and Margery stepped forth,
a skinny, defiant little Venus, challenging the world to look if it
dare. It was a most embarrassing moment for the little boys. Their
faces, bobbing about nervously on the surface of the water, blushed
violently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> and their jeers dwindled down to the merest quavers.</p>

<p>Her independence of custom and opinion thus emphatically established,
Margery lost no time in entering the water. Sitting gingerly on the
muddy bank, she slid forward one foot, then the other. Ugh! The bottom
of the pond was soft and slimy, and squashed up between her toes like
worms. For the first time a dreadful misgiving came over her. What if,
after all, swimming were not the delightful pastime it was cracked up
to be! However, there was no turning back now.</p>

<p>Sitting in the water, she propelled herself forward with her hands,
slowly and cautiously. The little boys looked on in marked though
unexpressed disapproval. Margery was putting them into a horribly
awkward position&mdash;there was no doubt about that. They didn't like it,
either. But in spite of themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> they were beginning to feel a
certain admiration for her pluck. It was almost a pity she was a girl.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Look out, Margery!" It was Tommy Grayson who gave the friendly
warning. "They's a tin can over there."</p>

<p>Margery shifted her direction, and soon reached deeper water, where
she was able to stand up without shocking the sensibilities of any
one. The little boys were still some distance from her. The water,
muddy beyond all chance of transparency, came up to their chests. To
them, however, this was not enough. The excessive modesty of eight or
nine made them keep even the white of their angular little shoulders
primly covered.</p>

<p>Now, human nature can not be expected to retain forever that freshness
of surprise which it feels over every new experi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>ence in life. Time,
philosophy tells us, accustoms man to almost anything. It does the
same for small boys. Beyond question it was enough to take the wind
out of any one to see a girl coolly strip and come in swimming quite
as though she were a boy, with all a boy's peculiar rights and
privileges. But, astonishing as that might be, it was after all no
reason for standing there all day like sticks in the mud when you
might just as well be having a good time.</p>

<p>Margery, who was also standing like a stick, felt as bored as they.
With nothing to do but gently bounce with the slight lap-lap of the
water, she found herself wondering more and more just where the fun of
swimming came in.</p>

<p>She watched with envy the small beginnings that betokened in the boys
a return to the serious play of life. Charley Burns gave Freddy Larkin
an unexpected ducking. Freddy came up splut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>tering and blowing, but
with a handful of slimy mud which he plastered over Charley's white
head. Then a splash fight became general. Every one splashed water
into every one else's face. Margery noted with interest the peculiar
downward stroke of the flat hand which brought about the finest
results. She added her shouts to the boys', and longed to add some
splashes likewise.</p>

<p>Now, the progress of a splash fight is thus: At first there are no
sides&mdash;every man's splash is against every man's; but the splashes of
all turn immediately against him who shows first signs of defeat; and
he, the victim, may then use any means whatever to protect himself.</p>

<p>Eddie Grote was the victim this time. When the deluge became choking,
he turned his back, ducked, and then let fly in the general direction
of the allied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> forces two slimy handfuls of mud. In the excitement of
the game the boys had clean forgot the immodesty of bare shoulders,
and had even broken away from their original close grouping until, to
all appearances, Margery was one of them. So it happened that, when
Freddy Larkin dodged aside, one handful of the watery mud caught
Margery square on the head and splattered down over her face and ears.</p>

<p>"Aw, see what you done, Eddie Grote!" Tommy Grayson shouted
indignantly. "You went and throwed mud on Margery's hair ribbon! Ain't
you got no sense?"</p>

<p>In the pause that followed, four little boys reviled the fifth with
various forms of, "Aw, what'd you do that for?" And the fifth stood
still in awkward consternation, the mud still dripping from his guilty
hand.</p>

<p>For a moment Margery, too, was con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>cerned, but only for a moment.
When, under any circumstances, one's world is coming to an end within
a few hours at furthest, a hair ribbon more or less matters very
little. Moreover, it suddenly flashed upon Margery that here was a
chance to make those few remaining hours more golden and at the same
time gratify her soul with a trial at that masterly downward stroke of
the flat hand. So before Eddie Grote had time to close his astonished
mouth, she filled it with a mighty splash of water. Then, while Eddie
choked and spluttered, too surprised to defend himself, she sent
another well-aimed splash and another, until the gasping Eddie was
forced to turn and flee. Not even then did Margery stop, but,
following up her advantage, she drove him on and on toward shore.</p>

<p>In their ecstasy at the spectacle, the remaining boys leaped up and
down in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> the water like happy little trout, clapping their hands and
shouting:</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Margery!"</p>

<p>"Give it to him, Margery!"</p>

<p>"I bet on Margery!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Margery?"</p>

<p>Eddie Grote was in a tight place. All woman's rights to the contrary,
in a struggle of the sexes a man has to show the woman some
consideration or fly in the face of public opinion. Eddie Grote,
although hard pressed, realized that public opinion would not in this
instance stand for what, ordinarily, would be his <i>modus operandi</i>,
namely, to fling mud over his shoulder. If he could but gain a
moment's time thus, he might make a dash for the deeper water. But he
could not, and the other little boys, as they saw his growing
predicament, raised shriller, louder shouts of joy:</p>

<p>"That's right, Margery! Chase him out of the water! Chase him out!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="pic_3" id="pic_3"></a>
<img src="images/image_03.jpg" width="600" height="383" alt="Eddie Grote was in a tight place." title="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Eddie Grote, ain't you ashamed? And before a girl, too! Oh! Oh!
Oh!"</p>

<p>Eddie Grote was ashamed, horribly ashamed. The water was fast falling
below his knees. To get back to the depths was impossible; to go
straight ahead were greater shame. Facing the inevitable, and
clutching frantically at the flying skirts of modesty, he doubled up
like a little turtle, chin to knees, and cried quits in those last
words of the conquered: "I give up! I give up!"</p>

<p>Margery, who knew the practices of modern warfare quite as well as he,
ceased fire and slowly backed away. She backed amid a chorus that was
like a triumphant "See the Conquering Hero Comes." Freddy Larkin
called out, "What's the matheh with Mardthery?" and the others took up
the chant:</p>

<p>h, what fun swimming was! Did anything else under heaven equal it?
Come, now, what might, she had drunk deep of one of life's joys, and
the memory of it would long sustain her. And then, while the boys were
still shouting her victory, while her heart was still glowing with the
thought of having made good before them, it came&mdash;a voice that was
like the voice of judgment.</p>

<p>"Margery!" it trumpeted sharply. "<i>Margery!</i>"</p>

<p>And at that voice five little Adams were suddenly afraid, and,
remembering the nakedness of their shoulders, hid themselves as best
they could in the muddy depths, and the solitary little Eve covered
herself likewise until the waters were up to her chin. Then six little
floating heads turned and gazed in speechless dismay at the knoll.
There stood Henry. In one hand he was clutching a tin can full of
something; from the other he had dropped a seine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="pic_4" id="pic_4"></a>
<img src="images/image_04.jpg" width="600" height="426" alt="&quot;Margery Blair, you come right out of that pond!&quot;" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<p>"Margery!" he repeated as though scarce able to believe his eyes. Then
as the vision remained fixed, he changed his tone.</p>

<p>"Margery Blair, you come right out of that pond!"</p>

<p>All the outraged conventionalities of an elder brother sounded in his
voice and showed in the horrified expression of his face.</p>

<p>Margery did not question fate, but meekly obeyed. Slowly and
reluctantly she made her way to shore. Henry was at the water's edge
to hasten her landing. He reached out and dragged her in&mdash;no longer a
defiant young Venus, but a very frightened little girl whose
naughtiness had found her out. Henry pushed her roughly toward her
pile of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> clothes with the succinct order, "Now dress." He made a
screen of his body between her and the five pairs of eyes that were
bobbing about so exasperatingly on the water.</p>

<p>Behind the screen Margery shivered helplessly. "Ain't got nothin' to
wipe with," she sniffled.</p>

<p>Very carefully and deliberately, without exposing for an instant the
form of his frail sister, Henry deposited on the ground his tin can of
minnows, went through all his pockets, and finally pulled out a small,
dirty handkerchief. As he handed this over his shoulder, the little
boys in the water laughed.</p>

<p>"Say, Henry, will you lend me that towel when Margery's through with
it?" asked Charley Burns facetiously.</p>

<p>"I'll punch your head when I ketch you. That's what I'll do to you."</p>

<p>Charley did not continue the subject.</p>

<p>Presumably the handkerchief served its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> purpose, for Margery's next
words showed that dressing had progressed a bit.</p>

<p>"I can't get my stockin's on," she quavered.</p>

<p>"Pull 'em on," grunted the screen unfeelingly.</p>

<p>A few moments later there was similar trouble with the shoes, and
Margery sent out a tearful announcement:</p>

<p>"They just won't go on."</p>

<p>"They got to," remarked the screen firmly.</p>

<p>"But I tell you they won't. They're my new ones and they won't go on
without a shoe-horn."</p>

<p>"Stamp on 'em!" commanded Henry gruffly.</p>

<p>Behind the screen convulsive excitement followed, accompanied by a
certain Jack-in-the-box effect which seemed highly to amuse the little
boys in the water.</p>

<p>"That's right, Margery. Stamp on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> 'em!" they repeated derisively until
cowed into silence by Henry's stony stare.</p>

<p>"I can't button my dress," was Margery's final plaint.</p>

<p>"You got to."</p>

<p>"But I tell you I can't," she insisted, her voice rising to a
long-drawn wail. "It buttons behind."</p>

<p>With the utmost dignity the screen slowly turned itself around. That
was a signal for the small boys in the water to break forth into jeers
and taunts. They spoke in that treble squeal which little boys use
when they seek to imitate girls' voices.</p>

<p>"Say, Henry, please lend me your towel to wipe my ears."</p>

<p>"Button my dress, Henry."</p>

<p>"Where's your shoe-horn, Henry?"</p>

<p>Apparently Henry's calm remained unshaken. In reality he made a rather
poor job of the buttoning. As soon as the back of the dress promised
to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> together, he stopped. Then, firmly clutching Margery's arm in
one hand and holding his seine and tin can of minnows in the other, he
faced his waspish little tormentors.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="56" height="50" /></div>
<p>he moment had come for him to speak. He did not hesitate. Had he been
forty-five and bald, he could not have met the situation with more
determined conventionality. He realized, plainly enough, that the
family had been disgraced, and neither to herself nor to the world
would he minimize or excuse Margery's culpability. Yet, nevertheless,
he would do his best to hush up the scandal.</p>

<p>"See here, you kids," he began warningly. Both hands were occupied, so
he could not emphasize his threat with the sight of a clenched fist.
His tones, however, carried conviction. "If any of you's blab about
this, I'll give you such a smashin'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Henry did not finish the sentence. There was no need to finish the
sentence. When one's thought has been fully enough expressed, why go
on further?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry paused a moment for the meaning to sink in. Then he started up
the knoll, dragging Margery after him. Instantly the pond was in an
uproar.</p>

<p>"Oh, Henry, can't guess who I seen in swimmin' this afternoon!"</p>

<p>"Comin' back to-morrow, ain't you, Margery?"</p>

<p>"Better slow up, Henry, or you'll drop your minnies."</p>

<p>"Say, Margery, your stockin's is comin' down."</p>

<p>Then Freddy Larkin started to chant at the top of his lungs:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Motheh, may I go out to thwim?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yeth, my darlin' daughter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hang your cloth' ...<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of course Margery knew that their wit was aimed at Henry, not at her.
But she breathed freer, nevertheless, once out of ear-shot.</p>

<p>Henry dragged her homeward at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> furious pace. He held her arm so
tightly that it ached. The worst was that she couldn't make him argue
about it. He simply held on without talking.</p>

<p>"You just let my arm go, Henry Blair," she whimpered again and again.
"You ain't got any right to hurt me."</p>

<p>But Henry would only close his mouth more grimly and push on.</p>

<p>"Ain't you got any sense, Henry Blair? I ain't tryin' to run off."</p>

<p>She might just as well be talking to a post.</p>

<p>Even the threat, "If you don't let me go, I'll holler," fell on deaf
ears.</p>

<p>This was said after they had reached the civilization of streets and
houses, where their appearance caused a mild sensation. And small
wonder. Margery's stockings were down in rolls about her ankles.
Behind, her dress was gaping open where Henry had missed the buttons.
In places there were yellow stains where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> the wet of her body had
soaked through. Her face was streaked with mud and her hair was drying
in a stiff mat that hung down heavily over her eyes. The once gorgeous
hair ribbon was little better than a lump of mud.</p>

<p>Several little girls on different porches called out in amazed
curiosity, "Why, Margery, what <i>is</i> the matter?" and a boy or two,
staring hard, remarked, "Hello, Henry. What you doin'?" For all the
attention he paid, Henry might not have heard. With lips tightly
closed, eyes looking straight ahead, he rushed on, never once relaxing
hold of his miserable victim's arm.</p>

<p>At their own gate they met the twins and Gladys Bailey just returning
from their round of calls. One look at the strange pair, and even
Gladys lost her air of blas&eacute; indifference. Her eyes opened wide and
she took a deep breath of interest and surprise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Henry," she said, "what in the world has Margery gone and done
now?"</p>

<p><i>What has Margery gone and done now?</i> If that wasn't like Gladys,
before she knew a thing about it to decide that Margery had gone and
done something! And when it was Gladys herself who was the cause of it
all, anyhow! Remembering this, Margery turned on her and snarled like
some angry little animal.</p>

<p>At this fresh token of savagery in his younger sister, Henry's face
grew quite apoplectic with shame. But, still keeping his mouth closed,
he pushed by Gladys and the twins, and dragged Margery up the steps of
the front porch.</p>

<p>"Oh, look at Margery's hair!" Gladys called out in virtuous concern.
"What <i>has</i> happened? You <i>must</i> tell us, Henry!"</p>

<p>Family shame might keep Henry's mouth closed, but Margery felt no such
restraint. She wanted Gladys to know! She wanted everybody to know!
So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> while Henry was freeing one hand of tin can and seine, preparatory
to opening the door, she twisted around until she, could shout out the
news to the listening world.</p>

<p>"I went in swimmin'!" she cried, shaking her muddied locks at Gladys.
"That's what!" She had to hurry, for Henry was already pulling at the
screen door. "With boys, too! With <i>boys</i>!"</p>

<p>Henry jerked her roughly into the house, but not before she had heard
the beginning of Gladys's unctuous comment: "Oh, how disgraceful!
Ain't Margery just too awful!" She also had time to realize vaguely
that, disgraceful though it was, Gladys seemed in no haste to turn on
the twins that cold glance of scorn which, by all reckoning, should
instantly have been forthcoming. Why did she stay on talking to them?
A cold doubt began to creep into Margery's mind. Had she, after all,
disgraced only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> herself? The doubt slowly grew to a certainty, until,
by the time she found herself dragged into the library, she felt as
miserable and forlorn as she looked.</p>

<p>Without a word Henry placed her before her mother. Her mother raised
languid eyes from a novel; then, like Gladys, showed livelier
interest.</p>

<p>"Margery! What have you been doing?"</p>

<p>"Swimmin'." Henry answered for her, in the first syllables he had
uttered since leaving the pond.</p>

<p>"Swimming!" repeated her mother faintly.</p>

<p>"With boys," added Henry gloomily.</p>

<p>"With boys!" echoed her mother, looking helpless and alarmed. The
occasion was evidently one which demanded a well-chosen reproof. She
paused a moment, then said impressively: "Why, I never heard of a
little girl doing such a thing!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>At that all Margery's waning spirit flared up. It was what they always
said! Whatever she did was bad, not because it <i>was</i> bad, but because
<i>she</i> was a girl!</p>

<p>"'Tain't my fault I'm a girl!" she cried, stamping her foot and
glaring out from under her muddy hair, more than ever like a little
creature of the woods. "I don't want to be a girl! I want to be a boy,
and you know I do!"</p>

<p>"That will do, Margery," said her mother coldly. "You may go to bed
now, and when your father comes home, I shall tell him how you've been
behaving and he can punish you. Henry, call Effie."</p>

<p>To Effie was intrusted the task of giving Margery a bath and putting
her to bed.</p>

<p>"She's been a bad girl this afternoon, Effie, and if she's rude to
you, you may spank her." And Margery's mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> thus shifting her
maternal responsibility, first to a servant, then to her husband,
returned to her novel with a troubled sigh.</p>

<p>When one is small and in the grip of adverse circumstances, there is,
perhaps, no process of life which can be made more humiliating than a
bath. In this instance, suffice to say that Effie was lavish in the
use of soap and water, especially soap, and, by the time she finished,
had reduced her charge to a state of quiescent misery.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_m.jpg" alt="M" width="63" height="50" /></div>
<p>argery's room was the small front corner room adjoining her mother's.
The window was open, and, as she lay in bed, feverish and unhappy, the
murmur of conversation from the porch below reached her distinctly.
She paid little attention until, hearing Gladys Bailey's voice, it
suddenly came over her that that young woman had not yet gone home.
Then Margery sat up and listened.</p>

<p>"I just feel so sorry for your poor father," Gladys's voice was
saying. "He'll feel so disgraced!" After a slight pause she asked:
"Don't you think he'll be home soon?"</p>

<p>So that was it! Gladys lingered on in hopes of witnessing the last
scene of Margery's humiliation. Oh, what a deceitful creature Gladys
was, pretending that the whole family was so disgraced, yet remaining
still as intimate with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> as ever! How horrid they all
were&mdash;everybody except, perhaps&mdash;perhaps her father! In the past he
was the only one who had ever shown himself superior to public opinion
and circumstantial evidence. Would he be the same this time? If he,
too, were going to be shocked and surprised, Margery felt that there
was nothing left for her but to go off somewhere alone and die.</p>

<p>"How many boys did you say they was, Henry?"</p>

<p>Henry evidently had not said, for he did not answer now. Nothing
daunted, Gladys went on.</p>

<p>"I suppose they was at least ten. Yes, I'm sure they must ha' been
ten."</p>

<p>"No, they wasn't," Henry blurted out. "They was only five."</p>

<p>Margery tossed about on her little bed in helpless rage and scorn.
Why, the creature was a regular Delilah!</p>

<p>"Who was they, Henry?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Again Henry kept silence. But this time Gladys's question was answered
in another way. From up the street came the various noises that
announce the approach of a crowd of boys.</p>

<p>"Here they come now," Gladys exclaimed in candid satisfaction.</p>

<p>Yes, without doubt they were coming. When they saw Henry they began
immediately a taunting sing-song:</p>

<p>"Oh, Henry, can't guess who I seen in swimmin'! Can't guess who I seen
in swimmin'!"</p>

<p>Henry dashed off the porch and the chorus scattered in various
directions. One saucy voice sang as it ran:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Motheh, may I go out to thwim?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yeth, my darlin' daughter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hang your cloth' ...<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yes, that was the whole thing in a nutshell, Margery thought. It was
exactly how they always talked to girls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hang your clothes on a hickory limb,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And <span class="smcap">don't</span> go near the water!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Wasn't it what her mother said to her a dozen times a day? <i>Now be a
good little girl and have a good time.</i> How could you be a <i>good</i>
little girl and have a good time at the <i>same</i> time? The irony of it,
when anybody with a grain of sense would know that the two do not go
hand in hand! If she had stayed home that afternoon, she would have
been good, but she would not have had a good time. As it was, she had
had a good time, but she had not been good. So there you are!</p>

<p>The gate clicked, but it was not Henry, for Gladys offered the
conciliatory greeting, "Hello, Willie." So it must be Willie Jones
coming through their yard to get to his own. Margery wondered whether
Gladys would be able to work him as she had worked Henry. Margery
thought not, but if she were&mdash;well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> she, Margery Blair, would have
very little more to say to Willie Jones.</p>

<p>When, Margery judged, Willie Jones was passing the porch, Gladys asked
in her suavest tones, "Oh, Willie, did you see Margery, too?"</p>

<p>For a moment Willie did not answer, and Margery, kneeling on the floor
behind the window curtain, held her breath. Then, apparently without
slowing his pace, Willie Jones grunted out in his roughest manner:</p>

<p>"Aw, go on! You don't know what you're talkin' about!"</p>

<p>"Willie Jones is just the rudest boy," Gladys informed the twins. "I
wouldn't think your mother would let Margery play with him."</p>

<p>But, up-stairs, Margery wept for joy at this evidence of a true and
noble heart.</p>

<p>Henry returned from the chase with the interesting news that he had
almost caught Freddy Larkin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I just pity your poor father," Gladys commented, "if he goes
down on the car to-morrow with Freddy Larkin's father."</p>

<p>"Why, Gladys?" chorused the twins anxiously.</p>

<p>"Because he'll laugh at your father and make fun of him for having a
girl that went in swimming with boys. Just you see! And your father'll
feel so disgraced!"</p>

<p>Would he really? Margery wondered forlornly. Of all her family, her
father was the one, the only one, she would have spared; and now, if
Gladys were to be trusted, he it was who would suffer most. With a
pang, she suddenly remembered how many times in the past she had been
sent to bed, as to-day, to await his coming, and how kind and just he
had always been, never pronouncing punishment until he had sifted and
weighed the evidence against her. And, remem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>bering this, her
rebellious little heart softened and a sense of regret came over
her&mdash;the first she had felt that afternoon. Why, why had she not
remembered him sooner? How could she <i>ever</i> have forgotten him?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the midst of this incipient remorse, Gladys announced his arrival.</p>

<p>He came in with a cheerful, "Hello, kidlets!" and almost immediately
asked, "Where's Margery?"</p>

<p>"Margery's in bed," Henry said significantly.</p>

<p>Margery heard her father pull over a porch chair and seat himself.</p>

<p>"She's been bad," Katherine said.</p>

<p>Still her father made no comment.</p>

<p>It was Alice's turn to speak, and there was nothing left to tell but
the deed itself.</p>

<p>"She went in swimmin'," Alice whispered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>And then, of all things, as Gladys Bailey would say, what did her
father do but laugh! He laughed loud and long; but the others,
evidently surprised, did not join him.</p>

<p>It was Gladys who spoke first.</p>

<p>"You forgot to tell your father that she went in swimmin' with boys."</p>

<p>"With boys!" her father echoed, and laughed harder than before.</p>

<p>Up-stairs, her head pressed against the window-sill, Margery could
scarcely believe her ears. Did he really think it was funny? And then
she had it. Her father was pretending! But that, after all, was only
half a clue. Why was he pretending? Why?</p>

<p>He stopped laughing after a time and began putting questions to each
of them in turn, until he had pieced together the whole story.</p>

<p>"Katherine," he asked finally, "why did you and Alice not take her
with you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> when you went calling? If you had, this would not have
happened."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, papa," began Katherine, "she's too little for our
crowd."</p>

<p>"Too little? What nonsense! She's not a bit too little."</p>

<p>"Well, Gladys says she is," Katherine insisted.</p>

<p>Gladys corrected this statement kindly but firmly: "What I said was,
that, for first calls, four was perhaps too big a crowd."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. That is very different. No doubt Gladys is entirely right.
But you've made your first calls now, haven't you?&mdash;and hereafter
Margery can go with you just as well as not, can't she, Gladys? Why,
you know, really, in crowds, the more the merrier. Besides"&mdash;and
Margery knew just as though she were there the kind of look her father
was giving Gladys&mdash;"as a favor to me!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Gladys was completely taken in.</p>

<p>"I'll be glad to do anything I can for you, Mr. Blair," she said
politely. Then she added gratuitously: "Everybody ought to be kind to
each other."</p>

<p>"That's it, exactly. As Gladys says, the big boys and girls should
always be kind and gentle to the smaller ones. Now Henry was right,
when he found his little sister doing something wrong, to bring her
home. But next time he's going to be more gentle about it, aren't you,
Henry?"</p>

<p>Yes, Henry was, and Margery hugged herself in wonder and amazement.
Why, her father was simply workin' 'em for all they was worth! He was
just jollyin' 'em to beat the band! And it was all for her sake, too!
Under the magic of his words, already they were ceasing to regard her
as an outcast. And Margery, like many another who has sought to
overturn the pillars of society, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> strangely happy at the thought
of being able once again to mingle with her own kind.</p>

<p>"But, papa," she heard Alice ask, "what'll you say to Freddy Larkin's
father on the car?"</p>

<p>"What will I say to Freddy Larkin's father on the car, Alice?"</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, when he&mdash;Gladys&mdash;she says he'll make fun of you on account
of Margery."</p>

<p>And then her father rose to the occasion magnificently.</p>

<p>"What will I say," he repeated in a loud, full voice, "to Freddy
Larkin's father when he makes fun of me for having a little girl who
went in swimming with the boys?"</p>

<p>He paused impressively, and suddenly Margery understood. He was the
only one of them all who knew that of course she was listening! And he
had known it all along and had been sending messages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> no, not of
excuse for her naughtiness&mdash;they would have that out together,
later&mdash;but of love and encouragement for herself. Oh, how she would
try never to grieve him again!</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll say," his adorable voice continued. "I'll
say, 'Well, I just bet you a great big round dollar that Freddy will
never see Margery do such a thing again!' Why, do you know, Gladys,
I'd be willing to risk five dollars!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Then he came into the house and her mother kept him a moment in the
library. She could not hear what her mother said, but her father's
answer, "Of course I shall be severe, if necessary," put a sudden
chill on her heart.</p>

<p>Then she heard his foot on the stairs; and she buried her face in the
pillow, pretending to be asleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Her father stood over her a moment, looking down at her quietly. She
could feel him looking. Then he said, "Margery," softly, gently. It
seemed to her that she had never heard her name pronounced so sweetly,
so lovingly. Whatever little ice of rebellion had formed anew around
her heart melted that instant, and, like a whirlwind, she threw her
arms about her father's neck and crushed her chill little nose and her
burning face against his cheek. There she sobbed out her love and
repentance.</p>

<p>"And papa&mdash;papa," she gasped as soon as she could speak, "you can bet
him ten dollars if you want to, and you won't lose! I promise you,
papa, you won't lose! You <i>won't!</i>"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Her mother supposed that, as usual, Margery had cajoled her father
into an easy mood, for, when she saw them an hour later, Margery was
seated on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> father's knee, quiet and happy. In all apparent
innocence she was saying:</p>

<p>"<i>And oh, papa! Ugh! It just squashes up between your toes like
worms!</i>"</p>
